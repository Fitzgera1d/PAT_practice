To store English words, one method is to use linked lists and store a word letter by letter. To save some space, we may let the words share the same sublist if they share the same suffix. For example, `loading` and `being` are stored as showed in Figure 1.

Figure 1

You are supposed to find the starting position of the common suffix (e.g. the position of `i` in Figure 1).

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains two addresses of nodes and a positive *N* (≤105), where the two addresses are the addresses of the first nodes of the two words, and *N* is the total number of nodes. The address of a node is a 5-digit positive integer, and NULL is represented by −1.

Then *N* lines follow, each describes a node in the format:

```
Address Data Next
```

where`Address` is the position of the node, `Data` is the letter contained by this node which is an English letter chosen from { a-z, A-Z }, and `Next` is the position of the next node.

### Output Specification:

For each case, simply output the 5-digit starting position of the common suffix. If the two words have no common suffix, output `-1` instead.

### Sample Input 1:

```in
11111 22222 9
67890 i 00002
00010 a 12345
00003 g -1
12345 D 67890
00002 n 00003
22222 B 23456
11111 L 00001
23456 e 67890
00001 o 00010
```

### Sample Output 1:

```out
67890
```

### Sample Input 2:

```in
00001 00002 4
00001 a 10001
10001 s -1
00002 a 10002
10002 t -1
```

### Sample Output 2:

```out
-1
```
