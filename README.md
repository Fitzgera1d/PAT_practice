**This repo is now archived since the owner has finished his programing test in Graduate Entrance Examination.**

You can compile the codes here using either Dev-C++(version 5.11.0.0) with compiler command `-std=c++11` or the [online compiler](https://pintia.cn/).

All the questions listed here are from [PAT (Advanced Level) Practice](https://pintia.cn/problem-sets/994805342720868352/exam/problems/type/7) and all the answers here have been **accepted**.

However, if you are looking to get a full score in the same test with me, these problems are not difficult enough especially in the concept of algorithm.
